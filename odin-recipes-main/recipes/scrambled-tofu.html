        <p>Add a tablespoon of olive oil to a pan and warm it over medium heat. 
            To crumble the tofu, I place the tofu in the pan, then mash it with a potato masher.
             Thatâ€™s my preferred method, but you could also simply crumble it into the pan with your hands, 
             or mash it with a fork. Cook it, stirring frequently for 3-4 minutes</p>


        <p>Next, add the nutritional yeast, salt, turmeric and garlic powder and cook for about 5 minutes, 
            stirring. Pour in the non-dairy milk and stir. Serve immediately!</p>
